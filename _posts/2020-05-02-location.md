## Travel Info
The University of Montana is located in Missoula, MT, the second largest city in the state.  It is located on ancestral lands of the [Salish tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederated_Salish_and_Kootenai_Tribes) and at the bottom of the former [Glacial Lake Missoula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Missoula).

Missoula is served by the airport MSO, which is accessible via several airlines, with direct flights from Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, and SLC.  Most hotels in the area (including those with preferred rates for this conference) offer complimentary shuttle service.  Taxi service and common ride-sharing apps are also available.
