# Northwest Glaciologists' Conference 2020
We invite you to join us in Missoula, MT on October 16th and 17th to share results, discuss new ideas, and to build collaborations with fellow glaciologists from the northwest and around the world.  

As always, the meeting will be informal with an emphasis on highlighting the work of students and early career scientists.  We strongly encourage presentations about the new, the controversial, and the possibly-hairbrained.  

We will have a social gathering at a TBD determined location near campus on Friday, the 16th.

Missoula has among the highest number of breweries per capita in the nation, and as such we will be organizing a walking tour visiting several of these fine establishments on Saturday night.  We will also be organizing an excursion to a local site of glaciological interest on Sunday the 18th.  

This page will be updated regularly with new information.  Please direct any questions to <northwestglaciologists2020@gmail.com>.

**Hope to see you there!**
