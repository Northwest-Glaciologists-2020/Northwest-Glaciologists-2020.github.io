# Northwest Glaciologists' Conference 2020
We invite you to join us virtually on October 14th-16th to share results, discuss new ideas, and to build collaborations with fellow glaciologists from the northwest and around the world.  

As always, the meeting will be informal with an emphasis on highlighting the work of students and early career scientists.  We strongly encourage presentations about the new, the controversial, and the possibly-hairbrained.   

This page will be updated regularly with new information.  Please direct any questions to <northwestglaciologists2020@gmail.com>.

**Hope you can join!**
